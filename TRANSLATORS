Thanks to all of those who have helped translate aurman, both in the past
and currently. Here are some of the current translators (past translators
can be found by looking in the GIT history).

If your language is listed here and you are interested in helping translate,
contact either the aurman mailing list at aurman-devel@lists.berlios.de, or one
of the translators listed above.

If your language is not listed here and you wish it was, let the aurman mailing
list know you are interested in making a translation. We will be happy to add
your language to the mix.
